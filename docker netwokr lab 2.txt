#Create the alpine-net network. You do not need the --driver bridge flag since it's the default, but this example shows how to specify it.

docker network create --driver bridge alpine-net

docker network ls

#inspect

docker network inspect alpine-net

Create your four containers. Notice the --network flags. You can only connect to one network during the docker run command, so you need to use docker network connect afterward to connect alpine4 to the bridge network as well.

docker run -dit --name alpine1 --network alpine-net alpine ash

docker run -dit --name alpine2 --network alpine-net alpine ash

docker run -dit --name alpine3 alpine ash

docker run -dit --name alpine4 --network alpine-net alpine ash

docker network connect bridge alpine4

#check all container

docker container ls

docker network inspect bridge


docker network inspect alpine-net


#Ping test

docker container attach alpine1
ping -c 2 alpine2
ping -c 2 alpine4

#It should fail for alpine 3, why?
ping -c 2 alpine3

#Stop and delete

docker container stop alpine1 alpine2 alpine3 alpine4

docker container rm alpine1 alpine2 alpine3 alpine4

docker network rm alpine-net
